# Arch Linux Install Script

In this repository you will find scripts for the minimal base install of BTRFS Arch Linux, minimal Plasma (or maybe minimal Gnome) Wayland (or maybe X.org), Nvidia driver (and maybe Snapper or Timeshift).
This scripts probably won't work for you. I'm configuring for my spesific use case.
